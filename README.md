Short description.
    Class list app is a web-instrument for one of Kiev school to manage the overall list of pupils (students) for period of war. The lists of pupils for each class are constantly changing. And some simple (and free) tool was requested by the school administration. CSV export/import is the other available option.

    I put this project here (at GitHub) to show some level of knowledge (HTML, CSS(SASS),  JS, React JS) and ability to apply it to the real cases. 

    Very simple interface without pictures, videos, animation was the main Customer requirement (just some basic transition effects were added). Adaptive responsive design (desktop-first technique, without bootstrap) ensures correct work for all reasonable screens (from 320px up to big ones).
